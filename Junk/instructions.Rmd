**Map**: this will show all articles located in cetral and south america. 

* EventCode: Filter by type of event
* Country: Filter by country
* Action: *View* - Option to only show the URL of the articles. *Scrape* - Option to scrape the content of the articles.
* Date: (not pictured) Filter by Date from the last week

This will also log all the chosen Scrape options into a Log folder. In here, every logged scrape will be saved into a .txt file

**ERRORS AND PROBLEMS**: 

* Trying to scrape when there are no visible plots will result in an error and crash. View before you Scrape.
* You *can* scrape ALL articles available, but this will take a very long time and I would highly recommend against it.
